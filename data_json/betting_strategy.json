    "text": "A betting strategy that has been successful in the past is the bet on the “double chance” 1X if an outsider plays against a favorite at home. In this case, the “1X” bet brings respectable odds and very interesting profit opportunities.You don’t even have to choose and analyze games that contain absolute extremes and obvious class differences with this strategy. So, you don’t necessarily have to bet against Barcelona, Bayern or Juventus as an away team. Here, we would probably move away from the value bets. Even if we opt for teams that are not big outsiders, but are still outsiders according to the odds, we find highly interesting odds between 1.60 and 2.50. "

    "text": "The 1-3-2-6 system is similar to another positive progression betting system known as a Paroli. Both involve increased stakes after a win, and both involve a cycle of bets ending at a fixed point. The only real difference is the actual betting sequence. Like many betting systems, the 1-3-2-6 was designed for bets that pay out an even sum, like the red-black bets in roulette. In fact, it is widely used on the roulette table and in other casino games such as baccarat, dice games and blackjack. Basically, it doesn’t matter what you use it for, provided you are playing with even sums."

    "text": "Fibonacci sequence betting is undoubtedly a controversial concept. But there are definitely sports bettors who were able to achieve great success with it. This strategy carries some risks, but with the necessary luck and the right nose, you can be successful while employing this strategy. It is important that the odds for the tie are above 2.62 (more precisely: 2.618); luckily for those who want to employ this strategy, there are many tie bets for this minimum odds. The higher the rate, the better."

    "text": "Dutching is the process of betting on more than one selection during the same event, so that no matter which selection wins, a profit can be made. This should not be confused with arbitrage, which involves betting on all possible outcomes of an event, so that a guaranteed profit is generated. This is only possible by using several bookmakers and only for a few events. Dutching is ideal for multi-outcome events where you think you can break the possible outcomes down to two or three; but in theory, you can bet on any number of selections. The fewer selections you make in dutching, the fewer losers you support and the more profit you make from them. However, by dutching fewer selections, you increase your risk."

    "text": "Have you ever regretted placing a particular bet and wished that you could somehow withdraw it? Or maybe you had doubts as to whether the team you supported could really hold the lead? If your answer to any of the questions is yes, then you’ll love the early withdrawal option. These properties give the speculator more control over the bets already placed and could ultimately make a big difference in the overall bankroll if you wager your cards correctly. The early payout is often referred to as the cashout by  most sports betting sites. "
